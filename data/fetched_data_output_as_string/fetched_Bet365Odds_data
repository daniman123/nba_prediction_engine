And that means doing whatever you can to understand odds tables. This NBA odds page showcases top-rated sportsbooks in your area, offering the most up-to-date odds for every game and futures market.</p><p class=''>Want to gain an instant advantage? Keep an eye out for odds highlighted in blue—they mark the best value for a particular wager.</p><p class=''>Each set of game odds also features three important additional features:</p><ul><li>The <b>Favorite</b> feature (indicated by a star to the left of the team names) lets bettors prioritize specific matchups on their main Odds page; simply click the star, and that game becomes a favorite.</li><li>The <b>Matchup </b>feature (indicated by the word \"Matchup\" to the right of the star) is a stathead's delight, transporting interested bettors to a page fully devoted to trends, comparisons and other game details for the game in question. Best of all, the Matchup page includes the best values for spread, total and moneyline plays.</li><li>The <b>Odds History</b> feature (indicated by parallel wavy lines to the right of the Matchup link) takes bettors through every major odds development since the lines first opened. Players can alternate between a variety of sportsbooks and quickly identify every time the spread or total shifted. </li></ul><h2 class=''>How to read NBA odds</h2><p class=''>NBA odds might cause some stress to beginner players – but we can take the stress out of betting on the wildly popular league. Here's how to read NBA odds:</p><ul><li>For <b>moneylines, </b>there is almost always a favorite (the team expected to win) and an underdog (the team expected to lose). The favorite will carry odds that have a minus sign beside them; let's use -150 as an example. In this situation, you would need to wager $150 to win $100, since the team you're betting on is considered the surer bet. Conversely, let's place +125 odds on the underdog; you would only need to wager $100 to win $125 since that team is a riskier play in the eyes of the oddsmakers.</li><li>For <b>point spreads and totals, </b>you are far more likely to see the odds at an identical -110. This is the standard for NBA wagers that are considered a \"coin flip\" by the sportsbooks. Using the above logic, we can see that bettors need to wager $110 to win $100, but in this case, the payout is the same regardless of which side the bettor chooses. As for why the odds aren't truly \"even\" in this case, the additional 10 cents on either side falls under what we call <b>vig</b> – essentially, the tax that sportsbooks levy for accepting a wager.</li></ul><p class=''>We have more on moneylines, spreads and totals in the next section.</p><h2 class=''>How to Bet on the NBA</h2><p class=''>Hoops fans will have a whopping 1,230 games to choose from this season – and each game provides a wide variety of betting opportunities, from pre-game to in-game markets. Here’s a breakdown of the main types of NBA bets:</p><h3 class=''>Point Spread Betting</h3><p class=''>The&nbsp;<b>point spread</b> is a betting innovation sportsbooks use to make a matchup more even.</p><p class=''>In this situation, the favored team is given a points handicap bettors must factor in when making their wagers; for example, the Boston Celtics are five-point opening night favorites vs. the New York Knicks, which means that anyone betting the Celtics on the spread will need Boston to win by more than five points in order for the bet to cash.</p><p class=''>Conversely, if the Celtics win by fewer than five points, or the Knicks win outright, all spread bets on New York will cash.</p><p class=''>Check out our detailed guide to <a href=\"https://www.sportsbookreview.com/how-to-bet-on-sports/spread-betting/\">spread betting</a> for tips and strategies.</p><h3 class=''>Moneyline Betting</h3><p class=''>While spread betting might seem daunting to some, wagering on the <b>moneyline </b>is as simple as it gets. Here, the bettor chooses which team he or she thinks is going to win. A team victory is a betting victory, no matter the margin of victory. </p><p class=''>There are, however, some caveats. Teams that are heavily favored might be tempting to pick, but players should bear in mind that the heftier the favorite, the worse the payout – meaning it will take a much higher bet to secure a decent return than if the matchup were more even.</p><p class=''>There's also the matter of line shopping, which refers to the practice of scouring multiple sports betting sites for the best price. Not all moneylines are equal across all sportbooks, so having access to multiple betting apps is a strong strategic play, even for casual bettors.</p><p class=''>Our comprehensive guide to <a href=\"https://www.sportsbookreview.com/how-to-bet-on-sports/what-is-the-money-line/\">moneyline betting</a> answers a lot of additional questions novice players might have about this bet type.</p><h3 class=''>Totals Betting</h3><p class=''><b>Totals (or over/under)</b> betting compares favorably with moneylines when it comes to the ease with which bettors can both understand and wager on them.</p><p class=''>Each NBA game carries a total that sports betting sites assign based on how many points they think will be scored. You, the player, then decide if the actual number of total points in the game will finish above or below the sportsbook's number.</p><p class=''>But that's far from the only application; in fact, the beauty of the totals bet is that it can be applied to dozens of NBA props markets, including team stats like points and 3-pointers made, and individual player stats like assists, blocked shots and turnovers.<br></p><p class=''>Looking for more? Check out our guide to <a href=\"https://www.sportsbookreview.com/how-to-bet-on-sports/over-under-betting/\">over/under betting</a>.</p><h3 class=''>Prop Betting</h3><p class=''>They're the games-within-the-games – and they're among the fastest-rising NBA bet types when it comes to overall popularity.</p><p class=''><b>Prop (or proposition) </b>betting shifts bettors' focus away from game outcomes and squarely on in-game outcomes involving players or teams. And no sport caters to the hard-core prop bettor like the NBA, which offers hundreds of prop markets for every game on the schedule.</p><p class=''>The key to successful prop betting lies in specialization. With so many options to choose from on any given Sunday, even more experienced gamblers would be wise to focus on specific types of props where their knowledge is strongest.</p><p class=''>It's also critical to be able to quickly identify value – and as mentioned earlier, having access to multiple&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sportsbookreview.com/best-sportsbooks/nfl-prop-betting-sites/\">prop betting sites</a> is an easy way to ensure that you're always getting the <a href=\"https://www.sportsbookreview.com/betting-odds/props/nba/\">best NBA player props each day</a> with the best odds for a given prop bet.</p><h3 class=''>Parlay Betting</h3><p class=''>When it comes to NBA bet types with wide-scale appeal, absolutely nothing compares to <b>parlay </b>betting – and that makes it the most divisive wagering category of all.</p><p class=''>A parlay combines two or more individual wagers (or \"legs\") into one bet, offering a larger payout than a standard bet but with a lower chance of success since players need every bet on their ticket to win. Bettors can even combine outcomes from the same matchup onto one card; these \"same-game parlays\" have exploded in popularity in recent years.</p><p class=''>Many traditionalists in the sports betting space believe that parlay betting is too much like playing the lottery, and will discourage players from building NBA parlays altogether. But with parlays making up the largest share of betting handle for nearly every sportsbook during the NBA season, it's clear where the public wants to spend its money.</p><p class=''>Our guide to <a href=\"https://www.sportsbookreview.com/how-to-bet-on-sports/parlay-betting/\">parlay betting</a> provides more info on parlay bet types, how to understand parlay odds, and strategies for parlay wagering.</p><h3 class=''>Futures Betting</h3><p class=''>The NBA offers a wide array of <b>futures</b> betting opportunities to sate bettors' appetite year-round. Bettors can decide on their choice of NBA champion as far as 12 months in advance, while individual awards markets are available for most of the year.</p><p class=''>Futures markets are among the simplest of them all: Choose the player or team you think will win, and if they do, then your ticket is victorious. and as an added bit of strategy, several of the top sports betting sites are now allowing bettors to cash out a futures wager – meaning you can accept a lower payout for settling your wager before the outcome is decided.</p><p class=''>Some bettors will use this option to make futures bets that don't necessarily have a good shot at succeeding, but are likely to see shorter odds in time, setting the stage for those players to accept a cash-out for more than their initial wager.</p><h2 class=''>How to choose NBA betting sites</h2><p class=''>Knowing hoops is only part of what will make you a successful NBA bettor.</p><p class=''>As with making any important purchase in life, the ability to shop around for the best NBA odds is a significant difference maker in this space. And we have several suggestions on how to find the best <a href=\"https://www.sportsbookreview.com/best-sportsbooks/nba-betting-sites/\" class=\"\">NBA betting sites</a> available in your area:</p><ul><li><b>Make quality of odds a priority. </b>Not only do you want to have access to the sportsbooks that carry the best NBA odds on a regular basis, you want those odds to be clearly displayed so you never have to struggle to see which book has the best price.</li><li><b>Take advantage of bonus offers. </b>Making sure you're dialed in to the <a href=\"https://www.sportsbookreview.com/bonuses/\">best sportsbook promos</a> is a low-risk way to ensure you're opening your NBA betting journey from the best possible starting point.
